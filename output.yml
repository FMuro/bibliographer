  abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal
    $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras.
    Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence
    of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given
    by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra
    and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact
    sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions
    of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence
    is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal
    Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related
    obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over
    (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the
    corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions
    of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously
    to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras
    and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees
    that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are
    used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential
    graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally,
    in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative
    operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra
    and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and
    a graded bimodule over it.

  abstract: We prove that the (homotopy) hypercommutative algebra structure on the
    de Rham cohomology of a Poisson or Jacobi manifold defined by several authors
    is (homotopically) trivial, i.e. it reduces to the underlying (homotopy) commutative
    algebra structure. We do so by showing that the DG operads which codify the algebraic
    structure on the de Rham complex of Poisson and Jacobi manifolds, generated by
    the exterior product and the interior products with the structure polyvector fields,
    are quasi-isomorphic to the commutative suboperad. Hence, there is no hope to
    endow the de Rham cohomology of such manifolds with any (higher) structure beyond
    the well-known (homotopy) commutative algebra structure, which exists for any
    smooth manifold. We proceed similarly with the commutative Batalin-Vilkovisky-infinity
    algebra structure on the de Rham complex of a generalized Poisson supermanifold.

  abstract: We work over a perfect field. Recent work of the third-named author established
    a Derived Auslander Correspondence that relates finite-dimensional self-injective
    algebras that are twisted $3$-periodic to algebraic triangulated categories of
    finite type. Moreover, the aforementioned work also shows that the latter triangulated
    categories admit a unique differential graded enhancement. In this article we
    prove a higher-dimensional version of this result that, given an integer $d\geq1$,
    relates twisted $(d+2)$-periodic algebras to algebraic triangulated categories
    with a $d\mathbb{Z}$-cluster tilting object. We also show that the latter triangulated
    categories admit a unique differential graded enhancement. Our result yields recognition
    theorems for interesting algebraic triangulated categories, such as the Amiot
    cluster category of a self-injective quiver with potential in the sense of Herschend
    and Iyama and, more generally, the Amiot-Guo-Keller cluster category associated
    with a $d$-representation finite algebra in the sense of Iyama and Oppermann.
    As an application of our result, we obtain infinitely many triangulated categories
    with a unique differential graded enhancement that is not strongly unique. In
    the appendix, B. Keller explains how -- combined with crucial results of August
    and Hua-Keller -- our main result yields the last key ingredient to prove the
    Donovan-Wemyss Conjecture in the context of the Homological Minimal Model Program
    for threefolds.

  abstract: We define two model structures on the category of bicomplexes concentrated
    in the right half plane. The first model structure has weak equivalences detected
    by the totalisation functor. The second model structure's weak equivalences are
    detected by the $E^2$-term of the spectral sequence associated to the filtration
    of the total complex by the horizontal degree. We then extend this result to twisted
    complexes.

  abstract: We define a $K$-theory for pointed right derivators and show that it agrees
    with Waldhausen $K$-theory in the case where the derivator arises from a good
    Waldhausen category. This $K$-theory is not invariant under general equivalences
    of derivators, but only under a stronger notion of equivalence that is defined
    by considering a simplicial enrichment of the category of derivators. We show
    that derivator $K$-theory, as originally defined, is the best approximation to
    Waldhausen $K$-theory by a functor that is invariant under equivalences of derivators.

  abstract: 'In a well generated triangulated category T, given a regular cardinal
    a, we consider the following problems: given a functor from the category of a-compact
    objects to abelian groups that preserves products of <a objects and takes exact
    triangles to exact sequences, is it the restriction of a representable functor
    in T? Is every natural transformation between two such restricted representable
    functors induced by a map between the representatives? If the answer to both questions
    is positive we say that T satisfies a-Adams representability. A classical result
    going back to Brown and Adams shows that the stable homotopy category satisfies
    Adams representability for the first infinite cardinal. For that cardinal, Adams
    representability is well understood thanks to the work of Christensen, Keller
    and Neeman. In this paper, we develop an obstruction theory to decide when T satisfies
    a-Adams representability. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions of homological
    nature, and we compute several examples. In particular, we show that there are
    rings satisfying a-Adams representability for all non-countable cardinals a and
    rings which do not satisfy a-Adams representability for any infinite cardinal
    a. Moreover, we exhibit rings for which the answer to both questions is no for
    infinite many cardinals. As a side result, we give an example of an infinite phantom
    map.'

  abstract: In this paper we introduce a new approach to determinant functors which
    allows us to extend Deligne's determinant functors for exact categories to Waldhausen
    categories, (strongly) triangulated categories, and derivators. We construct universal
    determinant functors in all cases by original methods which are interesting even
    for the known cases. Moreover, we show that the target of each universal determinant
    functor computes the corresponding $K$-theory in dimensions 0 and 1. As applications,
    we answer open questions by Maltsiniotis and Neeman on the $K$-theory of (strongly)
    triangulated categories and a question of Grothendieck to Knudsen on determinant
    functors. We also prove additivity theorems for low-dimensional $K$-theory and
    obtain generators and (some) relations for various $K_{1}$-groups.

    moduli stacks of algebras over an operad in a homotopical algebraic geometry context
    in the sense of To\"en and Vezzosi. We show under mild hypotheses that the moduli
    stack of unital associative algebras is a Zariski open substack of the moduli
    stack of non-necessarily unital associative algebras. The classical analogue for
    finite-dimensional vector spaces was noticed by Gabriel.

  abstract: We endow categories of non-symmetric operads with natural model structures.
    We work with no restriction on our operads and only assume the usual hypotheses
    for model categories with a symmetric monoidal structure. We also study categories
    of algebras over these operads in enriched non-symmetric monoidal model categories.

  abstract: The primary algebraic model of a ring spectrum is the ring of homotopy
    groups. We introduce the secondary model which has the structure of a secondary
    analogue of a ring. This new algebraic model determines Massey products and cup-one
    squares. As an application we obtain new derivations of the homotopy ring.

  abstract: In this paper we show that the Baues-Wirsching complex used to define
    cohomology of categories is a 2-functor from a certain 2-category of natural systems
    of abelian groups to the 2-category of chain complexes, chain homomorphism and
    relative homotopy classes of chain homotopies. As a consequence we derive (co)localization
    theorems for this cohomology.

  abstract: In this paper we address the classification problem for locally compact
    (n-1)-connected CW-complexes with dimension less or equal than n+2 up to proper
    homotopy type. We obtain complete classification theorems in terms of purely algebraic
    data in those cases where the representation type of the involved algebra is finite.
    For this we define new quadratic functors in controlled algebra and new homotopy
    and cohomology invariants in proper homotopy theory.

  abstract: "This is the final version of a series of papers uploaded in May 25, 2005.\
    \ We have splitted the long last paper of the previous version in two parts to\
    \ make it easier to understand. The results are essentially the same, although\
    \ the presentation has changed substantially. The first three papers have not\
    \ changed.\n  This is a collection of five papers on the foundation of triangulated\
    \ categories in the context of groupoid-enriched categories, termed track categories,\
    \ and characteristic cohomology classes. As a main result it is shown that given\
    \ an additive category A with a translation functor t: A --> A and a class V in\
    \ translation cohomology H^3(A,t) then two simple properties of V imply that (A,t)\
    \ is a triangulated category. The cohomology class V yields an equivalence class\
    \ (B,[s]) where B is a track category with homotopy category A and [s] is the\
    \ homotopy class of a pseudofunctor s: B --> B inducing t. The two properties\
    \ of V correspond to natural axioms on B and s which again imply that (A,t) is\
    \ a triangulated category.\n  The five papers of this volume depend on each other\
    \ by cross references, but each paper can be read independently of the others\
    \ so that the reader is free to choose one of the papers to start. Each paper\
    \ has its own abstract, introduction and literature."

  abstract: In this paper we determine the representation type of some algebras of
    infinite matrices continuously controlled at infinity by a compact metrizable
    space. We explicitly classify their finitely presented modules in the finite and
    tame cases. The algebra of row-column-finite (or locally finite) matrices over
    an arbitrary field is one of the algebras considered in this paper, its representation
    type is shown to be finite.
